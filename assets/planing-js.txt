Psuedo-Code for JS 

DECLARE objects for the 'player' and 'simon'
-- lol I really need to refactor AND ACTUALLY USE THESE
DECLARE variables to store number representations of red yellow green and blue


DECLARE state variables for 'simonMoves', 'playerMoves', and 'loseState'. 

REFERENCE 'greenBtn' 'redBtn' 'yellowBtn, 'blueBtn' 'howToPlayBtn', 'playBtn', and 'h2'.

ATTACH event listeners for the color buttons, 'howToPlayBtn', and 'playBtn'.

DECLARE event handler function for the color buttons event listeners
 - What should happen when a color button is clicked? 
    - Each color button should "flash" when clicked then return to their initial state
    - When a button is clicked it should add a string to the playerMoves string using concatenation

DECLARE event handler function for the 'howToPlayBtn' event listener 
 - What should happen when the button is clicked? 
    - plan this out when I make this modal in HTML

DECLARE event handler function for the 'playBtn' event listener 
 - What should happen when the button is clicked?
    - the gameplay should commence! 
    - change into the game play function 

DECLARE a function for gamePlay (without multiple round functionality)
- change into the next round *** this is a stretch ignore this at first pass
- change the round name to the applicable round name *** this is a stretch ignore this at first pass
- Have 'Simon' choose a random order of the colors to flash 
- Flash those colors 
- store those color choices in simon's array 
- wait for player clicks (maybe make a gameboard listener for this)
- compare player choices to simon choices and determine if game could continue or if the game should end 
- display the oops modal if the game ends

DECLARE a function to make Simon pick an order of colors - hard code the number of them and revisit this later
