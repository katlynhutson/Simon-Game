Psuedo-Code for JS 

DECLARE objects for the 'player' and 'simon'

DECLARE state variables for 'simonMoves', 'playerMoves', and 'loseState'. 

REFERENCE 'gameBoard', 'howToPlayBtn', and 'playBtn'.

ATTACH event listeners for the 'gameBoard', 'howToPlayBtn', and 'playBtn'.

DECLARE event handler function for the 'gameBoard' event listener 
 - What should happen when the 'gameBoard' field is clicked? 
    - Each color button should "flash" when clicked then return to their initial state
    - When a button is clicked it should add a string to the playerMoves array

DECLARE event handler function for the 'howToPlayBtn' event listener 
 - What should happen when the button is clicked? 
    - plan this out when I make this modal in HTML

DECLARE event handler function for the 'playBtn' event listener 
 - What should happen when the button is clicked?
    - the gameplay should commence! 
    - change into the game play function 

DECLARE a function for gamePlay (without multiple round functionality)
- change into a round function
- change the round name to the applicable round name 
- Have 'Simon' choose a random order of the colors to flash 
- Flash those colors 
- store those color choices in simon's array 
- "listen" to player choices 
- compare player choices to simon choices and determine if game could continue or if the game should end 
- display the oops modal if the game ends


*** I may rethink this so that the player object contains the moves array and the simon object contains the simon moves array***

*** I will hopefully make this dryer by making my event listener for the gameboard buttons work for every button without having to grab each individually
