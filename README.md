## Planning Process

### User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- As a user, I want my button clicks for the color sections to be stored round to round, so that I can attempt to replicate the computer pattern.

- As a user, I want my button color clicks order compared to the random color order, so that I can advance to the next round or exit the game and start over

- As a user, I want the number of colors I'm supposed to replicate to increase by one each round, so that the game is challenging.

- As a user, I want the amount of rounds I've completed to be tracked on the browser, so that I know how far I got at the end.

- As a user, I want the colors that are presented to replicate to be random, so that the game is not predictable.

- As a user I want the 'how to play' button to display game directions, so that I know the game progression and how to play.

- As a user I want an obvious and clear indication for the buttons being selected to be replicated, so that I know exactly which buttons to push and don't miss the prompt.

#### Stretch Goals

- As a user I want a sound attached to each button that will play when pressed by the user or selected at random to be replicated, so that I can enjoy the game with more senses, remember what was selected, and be more accessible.

- As a user I want the message that displays at the end of the game to be a random encouraging message, so that the sting of the loss is soothed and the game stays feeling fresh.

- As a user I want to choose the speed in which the buttons are indicated by difficulty level, so I can have more customization over my gameplay.
